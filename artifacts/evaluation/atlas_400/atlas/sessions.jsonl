Although the tool was correctly chosen and parameters appeared reasonable, the response did not achieve the desired CRM state change (quote creation). The output was complete and safe, but the primary requirement—successful quote creation—was unmet. Hence, the correctness principle scores zero, with partial compliance to tool use and safety.
